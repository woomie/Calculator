I found a calculator on dribble i'm trying to recreate it
1. I would have a div containter that looks like an iphone
2. I would have two divs inside 
3. the first div is the display where you see all the user is inputing
4. the second div is where the buttons would be
5. The display for both divs in the container would be flex
5. I would create a grid for the buttons a 4 by 5 grid
7. I want anything I press in the calculator div (grid items )to show on my diplay.
8. I want it to perform arithmetic operations.
9. I want the numbers diplayed to perform the arithmetic operations.
